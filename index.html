Additionally, her leadership was recognized in an upcoming Associated Press feature, set to be published on March 10th. Katelyn credits the Binfluencers program with not only empowering her to take action but also making community-driven environmental change feel both achievable and essential.Our second California based influencer, Arman, is leading Recycle Right, a campaign to tackle waste contamination by educating residents on proper recycling habits. Through visual guides, improved bin signage, and interactive community events, they aim to make recycling rules clear and easy to follow. By partnering with local schools, nonprofits, and cultural organizations, they ensure that underrepresented groups have access to multilingual recycling education, making sustainable waste management a community-wide effort.</p>",
        "Texas":
          "<p>In Texas, Aria is developing accessible ways for Dallas residents to recycle non-traditional items like metal car parts, electronics, and hangers to prevent them from ending up in landfills. Alternatively, Saanvi is leading a campaign to reduce recycling contamination by advocating for better recycling practices at Domino’s Pizza. Through a letter-writing initiative, Saanvi is mobilizing students and community members to push for sustainable packaging solutions. Additionally, they are working with a POC Youth Board and local cultural organizations to provide multilingual recycling education, ensuring that Dallas’ diverse communities have the knowledge and resources to recycle correctly.</p>",
        "Louisiana":
          "<p>In New Orleans, Jordan is working to improve waste management in Black-owned beauty supply stores, salons, and corner shops by introducing recycling services and educational materials. By partnering with local waste disposal companies, they aim to ensure that plastic packaging, chemical products, and other waste are properly handled. Their initiative will also collect data on waste reduction to advocate for increased funding and policy changes that benefit Black neighborhoods.</p>",
